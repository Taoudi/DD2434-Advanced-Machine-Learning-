""" This file is created as the solution template for question 2.3 in DD2434 - Assignment 2.

    Please keep the fixed parameters in the function templates as is (in 2_3.py file).
    However if you need, you can add parameters as default parameters.
    i.e.
    Function template: def calculate_likelihood(tree_topology, theta, beta):
    You can change it to: def calculate_likelihood(tree_topology, theta, beta, new_param_1=[], new_param_2=123):

    You can write helper functions however you want.

    If you want, you can use the class structures provided to you (Node, Tree and TreeMixture classes in Tree.py
    file), and modify them as needed. In addition to the sample files given to you, it is very important for you to
    test your algorithm with your own simulated data for various cases and analyse the results.

    For those who do not want to use the provided structures, we also saved the properties of trees in .txt and .npy
    format.

    Also, I am aware that the file names and their extensions are not well-formed, especially in Tree.py file
    (i.e example_tree_mixture.pkl_samples.txt). I wanted to keep the template codes as simple as possible.
    You can change the file names however you want (i.e tmm_1_samples.txt).

    For this assignment, we gave you three different trees (q_2_3_small_tree, q_2_3_medium_tree, q_2_3_large_tree).
    Each tree have 5 samples (whose inner nodes are masked with np.nan values).
    We want you to calculate the likelihoods of each given sample and report it.

    This function calculates the likelihood of a sample of leaves.
